# Breast Cancer Classification

This repository's major objective is to clearly demonstrate the procedures of data preprocessing while also creating a machine learning model from scratch. We made use of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set to accomplish our objective. You can examine the code from the file of "breast_cancer_classification.ipynb".

## Summary

We built a model that can predict whether a person is suffering from breast cancer or not by looking at the data. First, we preprocessed the data, then we used a KNN classifier. We got 95.3%, 95.9%, 92.4% and 99.4% accuracies respectively. The last one is our final accuracy value. Consequently, we predicted the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set with 99.4% accuracy.
